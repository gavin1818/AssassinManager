<h2>Program Details:</h2>
<div>“Assassin” is a game often played on college campuses. Each person playing has a particular target that he/she is trying to “assassinate.” Generally “assassinating” a person means finding them on campus in public and acting on them in some way (e.g. saying “You’re dead,” squirting them with a water gun, or touching them). One of the things that makes the game more interesting to play in real life is that initially each person knows only who they are assassinating; they don’t know who is trying to assassinate them, nor do they know whom the other people are trying to assassinate.</div>
<h2>Assassin Rules</h2>
• You start out with a group of people who want to play the game

• A circular chain of assassination targets (called the “kill ring” in this program) is established. 

• When someone is assassinated, the links need to be changed to “skip” that person.
